## Production architecture (real device)

On the actual hardware, the setup is straightforward:

- The **device** captures audio from its mic, encodes it (likely Opus to save bandwidth), and streams it to a backend over WiFi or cellular
- The **backend** is the orchestrator. It forwards audio to AssemblyAI for STT, sends the transcript to a translation API, generates TTS audio, and sends the result back to the device
- The **device speaker** plays the translated audio
- **API keys live on the backend**, never on the device. The device would authenticate with the backend using its own device credentials.

## Demo architecture (browser simulation)

I don't have the physical hardware, so I used a web browser to stand in for the device. Here's what maps to what:

| On the real device                | In the demo                   | Notes                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Built-in mic                      | `getUserMedia()`              | Browser prompts for mic permission; the real device wouldn't need that                                           |
| On-device audio encoder (Opus)    | AudioWorklet (PCM16 at 16kHz) | Demo sends raw PCM16 instead of Opus. In production you'd use Opus to cut bandwidth -- AssemblyAI supports both. |
| Built-in speaker                  | HTML5 `<audio>` element       | Browser decodes base64 MP3 and plays it. Real device would pipe MP3 directly to its speaker.                     |
| WiFi / cellular to remote backend | localhost WebSocket           | Demo runs locally. Real device connects to a remote backend.                                                     |

## \
The key point

The backend and all cloud API calls are **identical** between demo and production. Swapping in the real device is purely a client-side change -- the server doesn't need to be rewritten. I designed it that way on purpose so the demo isn't throwaway work; it's a proof of concept for the actual deployment.
