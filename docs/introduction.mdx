## The problem

iTranslate has a portable, battery-powered handheld translation device. Think Pocketalk form factor. It connects to the internet over WiFi or cellular, but it has **no GPU** -- no way to run model inference on-device.

The device needs to:

- Capture speech from a built-in mic
- Transcribe it in real time
- Detect which language is being spoken (no manual switching)
- Translate into the other person's language
- Speak the translation out loud

Since there's no on-device compute, the entire STT-to-translation-to-TTS pipeline has to run in the cloud. The device is basically a thin client -- it streams audio out and gets results back.

## My approach

I built a working demo that simulates this end-to-end:

1. **Audio capture** -- a browser mic standing in for the device's hardware mic
2. **Real-time STT** -- AssemblyAI's Universal Streaming API with automatic language detection
3. **Translation** -- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
4. **Text-to-speech** -- OpenAI TTS-1, with per-language voice mapping
5. **Playback** -- translated audio plays back through the browser (standing in for the device speaker)

The backend and all cloud service calls are identical to what production would look like. The only difference is what sits on the client side -- a browser instead of the real hardware.

## Tech stack

| Component | What I used | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| STT | AssemblyAI Universal Streaming (Multilingual) | Real-time streaming with built-in language detection. No need to specify the language upfront. |
| Translation | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini | Fast, low latency, good translation quality. |
| TTS | OpenAI TTS-1 | Simple API, multiple voices, low latency. |
| Server | Node.js + TypeScript | iTranslate said they're a Python/TypeScript shop. Node is great for WebSocket-heavy workloads. |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS | Zero build step. Keeps the demo easy to run. |
| Audio capture | Web Audio API (AudioWorklet) | Off-main-thread audio processing with precise control over sample rate and chunk size. |
