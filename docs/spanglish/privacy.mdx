## The concern

Spanglish Inc. transcribes court proceedings -- sensitive legal conversations. They need to be confident that no audio or transcript data from their streams is being stored or used by AssemblyAI.

## Streaming: zero data retention

For streaming transcription, AssemblyAI offers **zero data retention** when the customer has opted out of model training. That means:

| Data type | Retained? |
|-----------|-----------|
| Audio data | No -- not stored after the session ends |
| Transcript data | No -- not stored after the session ends |
| Session metadata (timestamps, duration, billing) | Yes -- retained for logging and billing |

This is the default behavior for customers who opt out. No audio, no transcripts, no PII -- just metadata.

## Model training

AssemblyAI may use submitted data for model training, **but only as permitted by contract**, and with the following safeguards:

- All training data undergoes **PII redaction** before use
- Model training is **completely prohibited** if any of these apply:
  - You have a **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)**
  - You use **European servers** (`streaming.eu.assemblyai.com`)
  - You have **opted out** of model training in your account settings

For Spanglish Inc., I'd recommend opting out of model training at minimum. If they handle HIPAA-adjacent data, a BAA is the right move.

## Additional compliance options

### Business Associate Agreement (BAA)

Available for customers handling protected health information or similarly sensitive data. A BAA guarantees:

- Zero data retention (audio + transcripts)
- No model training on your data
- Contractual compliance obligations

Court proceedings may not fall under HIPAA specifically, but a BAA provides the strongest contractual privacy guarantee AssemblyAI offers.

### EU data residency

If data sovereignty matters, Spanglish Inc. can route all traffic through AssemblyAI's EU endpoint:

```
wss://streaming.eu.assemblyai.com/v3/ws
```

This ensures audio is processed within the EU. All the same privacy guarantees apply, plus data never leaves EU infrastructure.

### Data Processing Addendum (DPA)

Available on request for additional contractual protections around how data is processed, stored, and deleted.

### On-demand deletion

Customers can request immediate deletion of any retained data at any time by contacting support@assemblyai.com.

## What I told the customer

In the customer email, I laid out:

1. Streaming has zero data retention when opted out of model training
2. Only session metadata is kept for billing
3. A BAA is available and recommended for their use case
4. EU residency is an option if needed
5. They can request immediate data deletion at any time

For court proceedings, the combination of **opt-out + BAA** gives them the strongest assurance: no audio stored, no transcripts stored, no model training, and a contractual guarantee backing all of it.
