## The situation

While I was working on the iTranslate demo, a high-priority production customer -- Spanglish Inc. -- reached out saying our streaming product "doesn't work at all." They were at serious risk of churning.

**Who is Spanglish Inc.?** They build note-takers for bilingual conversations (English and Spanish), like court proceedings with an interpreter present. They were already in production with our async API and were migrating to streaming.

The Applied AI Engineer who normally handles this account was out of office. I jumped in.

## What they sent us

A Java WebSocket client (`Spanglish.java`) that connects to our Streaming v3 API, captures microphone audio, streams it for real-time transcription, and saves a local WAV recording. About 300 lines of code.

## What I found

After reviewing the code against our [Streaming v3 API docs](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming), I identified **five bugs** -- all in the customer's client-side code. None in our API.

| # | Bug | Severity | Why it matters |
|---|-----|----------|----------------|
| 1 | `main()` instantiates `StreamingTranscription` instead of `Spanglish` | Critical | Code doesn't compile |
| 2 | `encoding=opus` in the endpoint URL | Critical | Opus isn't a valid v3 encoding -- server can't decode the audio |
| 3 | No `speech_model` specified | Critical | Defaults to English-only, but they need English + Spanish |
| 4 | `FRAMES_PER_BUFFER=400` (25ms chunks) | Medium | Below the API's 50ms minimum per message |
| 5 | No `language_detection` enabled | Low | Misses per-utterance language metadata useful for bilingual transcripts |

The encoding mismatch (bug 2) was the primary reason everything appeared completely broken. The code captures raw PCM16LE audio but tells the server it's Opus-encoded. The server tries to decode Opus frames, gets garbage, and produces no transcription.

## The bottom line

This is **not a bug in our API**. The Streaming v3 API behaved exactly as designed. All five issues are client-side misconfigurations. The fixes are straightforward -- see the next page.

## What else the customer needs

Beyond the code fix, Spanglish Inc. had two follow-up requests:

1. **Scaling to 2,000 concurrent streams** -- they want to go big in production immediately
2. **Data privacy reassurance** -- they need confidence that no customer data (court proceedings) is being retained

I addressed both. Details in the [Scaling](/spanglish/scaling) and [Privacy](/spanglish/privacy) pages.
