title: "What I found"

After reviewing the code against our [Streaming v3 API docs](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming), I identified **five bugs**, all in the customer's client-side code. None in our API.

| # | Bug                                                                   | Severity | Why it matters                                                          |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | `main()` instantiates `StreamingTranscription` instead of `Spanglish` | Critical | Code doesn't compile                                                    |
| 2 | `encoding=opus` in the endpoint URL                                   | Critical | Opus isn't a valid v3 encoding -- server can't decode the audio         |
| 3 | No `speech_model` specified                                           | Critical | Defaults to English-only, but they need English + Spanish               |
| 4 | `FRAMES_PER_BUFFER=400` (25ms chunks)                                 | Medium   | Below the API's 50ms minimum per message                                |
| 5 | No `language_detection` enabled                                       | High     | Misses per-utterance language metadata useful for bilingual transcripts |

The encoding mismatch (bug 2) was the primary reason everything appeared completely broken. The code captures raw PCM16LE audio but tells the server it's Opus-encoded. The server tries to decode Opus frames, gets garbage, and produces no transcription.

## The bottom line

This is **not a bug in our API**. The Streaming v3 API behaved exactly as designed. All five issues are client-side misconfigurations. The fixes are straightforward, see the next page.

## What else the customer needs

Beyond the code fix, Spanglish Inc. had two follow-up requests:

1. **Scaling to 2,000 concurrent streams**: they want to go big in production immediately
2. **Data privacy reassurance**: they need confidence that no customer data (court proceedings) is being retained

I addressed both. Details in the [Scaling](/spanglish/scaling) and [Privacy](/spanglish/privacy) pages.
